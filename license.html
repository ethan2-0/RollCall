            RollCall is free as in freedom.<br/>
            That's our license in six words.
        </div>

                <span class="title-main">"Why should I care?"</span>
            RollCall is free software. But, why is that so special? "I use Windows and Chrome, and they aren't free software," you say.<br/>
            <br/>
            I would encourage you to watch <a href="youtu.be/Ag1AKIl_2GM">Richard Stallman's talk at TEDxGeneva in 2014</a>. Here's some more food for thought:<br/>
            <br/>
            Well, it comes down to your freedoms and a guarantee of privacy. How do you know that Google hasn't put a backdoor into Chrome, allowing
            anyone at Google to see exactly what you're doing? How do you know that Microsoft hasn't put a backdoor into Windows, allowing them to take control into your computer?
            (<a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/02/further-evidence-lenovo-breaking-https-security-its-laptops">happens</a>)
            The truth is, you don't. But, when you use free software, people can do
            (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenBSD#Alleged_FBI_backdoor_investigated">and</a>
            <a href="http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/05/openssl-to-get-a-security-audit-and-two-full-time-developers/">have</a> done) extensive reviews
            to figure out whether people have, or even just if someone's made a mistake.<br/>
            <br/>
            Additionally, when you use free software, you're gaining the freedom to make changes to it, and even redistribute those changes
            to other people (as long as you tell them it's been changed). Richard Stallman, founder of the Free Software Foundation, often tells a story about the
            printers at MIT. The software for the printers was free software. Since printing often took quite a while, they modified them so it would tell you
            on your terminal when your printing job was done. Then, they got new printers that were not free software, so they couldn't make any modifications; they lost
            out, because MIT had chosen proprietary printer software over free software.<br/>
            <br/>
            These days, the term "open source" is often used to mean "free software". However, "open source" has another meaning, which is that you distribute the source
            along with your product, but do not allow people to modify or redistribute it. This is good in some cases, but for the most part not as useful. When we say
            free software, we mean free as in freedom.<br/>
            <br/>
            One prominent example of free software is Linux; another is Firefox. We reccommend you use Firefox and Linux to maintain a free software stack; we do.
                <span class="title-main">Can you give me a quick summary of the license?</span>
            RollCall is distributed under the BSD 3-clause license. Here is what it means:
            <ul>
                <li>When the software is distriubted, it must display the license [available below, in this case].</li>
                <li>If you distribute without the source, you still have to include the license.</li>
                <li>You can't use my name to endorse your modified versions.</li>
                <li>This software is provided with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; it is provided "as is." There is not even the warranty of "merchantibility" or "fitness for a particular purpose".
                The author may never be held liable for any damages caused by this program, "arising in any way out of the use of the software,"
                even if you lose data, have your laundry eaten, or any other form that damage could take, even if the author knew that damage could happen; even if the damage is caused by negligence or
                any other cause.</li>
            </ul>
                <span class="title-main">Actual License</span>
            The following is the license. It's not actually that complicated; you don't have to be a lawyer to understand it. It's the BSD 3-clause license, present at the top of every file.
