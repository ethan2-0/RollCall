            <br/>
            RollCall is the cullimination of a lot of work by the free software community.<br/>
            We just put it together.
        </div>
        <div style="width: 60vw; font-size: 18px; margin-left: 20vw; margin-bottom: 5vh;">
            <br/>
            Here are all of the projects that RollCall depends on. Without these, this service would be impossible.
                <span class="title-main">Bootstrap</span>
            Bootstrap is a UI framework, and it's just awesome. I don't think I'll ever develop a website without it ever again; the grid system is especially useful.
            We use it mostly for its grid system, buttons, and dialogs - but it's used in a lot of other places, too.<br/>
            <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Official Website</a> | <a href="https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/">GitHub</a>
                <span class="title-main">jQuery</span>
            jQuery makes DOM interaction and AJAX so much easier, thus making pretty much all the UI code much easier to write. Literally everything you see in the RollCall webapp is put there by jQuery.
            <br/>
            <a href="https://jquery.com/">Official Website</a> | <a href="http://github.com/jquery/jquery">GitHub</a>
                <span class="title-main">Firebase</span>
            All the data is stored in Firebase. Not only that, I don't have to remember the syntax of SQL, or worry about query injection vulnerabilities, or even worry about the server at all - they 
            handle it.<br/>
            <a href="https://www.firebase.com/">Official Website</a>
                <span class="title-main">PeerJS</span>
            PeerJS handles all of the calls. Every second of call you make is because of PeerJS. I don't think I need to say more.<br/>
            <a href="http://peerjs.com">Official Website</a> | <a href="https://github.com/peers/peerjs">GitHub (client source)</a> | <a href="https://github.com/peers/peerjs-server">GitHub
            (server source)</a>
                <span class="title-main">Velocity.js</span>
            Velocity.js does almost all of the animations. It's easy to use, and it's <i>really</i> smooth - always smoother than jQuery animations, and usually smoother than CSS transitions.<br/>
            <a href="http://julian.com/research/velocity/">Official Website</a> | <a href="https://github.com/julianshapiro/velocity">GitHub</a>
                <span class="title-main">Bootbox.js</span>
            All of the modal dialogs are handled by Bootbox.js. Although I could have done them by hand with Bootstrap, Bootbox makes it much, much easier and shorter.<br/>
            <a href="http://bootboxjs.com/">Official Website</a> | <a href="https://github.com/makeusabrew/bootbox">GitHub</a>
                <span class="title-main">CSS3 &amp; HTML5</span>
            Literally, I'm thanking the internet here - this entire website is possible only due to the HTML5 effort and CSS3. HTML5 makes HTML so much more powerful.
                <span class="title-main">WebRTC</span>
            WebRTC is the underlying framework behind PeerJS. It's an effort to enable real-time communications, or RTC on the web, hence WebRTC. It is kind of an odd specification in that it
            leaves many areas undefined, but with a good library, it's really powerful.<br/>
