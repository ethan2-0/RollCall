            Everything personal is encrypted.<br/>
            That's our privacy policy in four words.

            RollCall has real privacy. But, you say, "Why should I care? I use Google, and it tracks me, and I use Chrome, and it tracks me, and I use Windows, which tracks me,
            too (albeit much more insidiously)."
            OK. Here it goes.<br/>
            <br/>
            Twenty years ago, privacy was a big concern for computer systems. But now (possibly thanks to a massive propaganda campaign by the American government and media),
            few people truly care about privacy (or say they do, at least). Here's an extreme example. In many books (including George Orwell's <i>1984</i>, the pinnacle of this genre),
            a society is depicted in which many fundamental freedoms really do not exist. One of these freedoms that is violated almost 100% of the time, and is often the first to go,
            is privacy. In these societies
            without privacy, any expressions of disagreement with the government is frowned upon, if not illegal. This is used as a means of information supression; if anyone attempts
            to rally support against the government, the authorities know instantly, thanks to the spying; then, the dissident is labeled a terrorist, threat to national security, etc.,
            and supressed. When you let one freedom fall, the others fall like dominoes; right now, privacy is under the most threat, yet is most important.
                <span class="title-main">"But I don't care about privacy" or "I have nothing to hide"</span>
            Watch <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/glenn_greenwald_why_privacy_matters">this</a> TED talk. Glenn Greenwald explains it much better than I do. In short:<br/>
            <br/>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    People often say they have nothing to hide, when they really do. For example, you (the reader) probably have an e-mail account or online banking account.
                    I'm going to assume you have a password on it [if not, pretend you do for the sake of argument]. Why do you keep that password a secret? Why don't you instead display it
                    the entire world? Because you care about privacy. Even though you're doing nothing wrong, there is a certain level of expected privacy inherent in being human.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you truly don't care about privacy, why don't you tell me the password to your online banking account, or your e-mail; I promise I won't send any e-mails, or transfer
                    any money. [Don't actually do that; if you do, read the last paragraph of the license first, and I take no responsibility whatsoever for what happens to it.]
                    Glenn Greenwald claims to make that offer every time someone uses that
                    point on him, and has (unsurprisingly) never had anyone ever take him up on it.
                </li>
                <li>
                    That's about the level of accountability; there's no judicial oversight. At the NSA, where over 100,000 people have access to everything you have ever sent or recieved on Skype,
                    any e-mails or text messages, the metadata on phone calls (and it is suspected that they also have access to the contents), your Google search history, and a <i>lot</i> of
                    data from Windows, there was a practice of trading nude or partially nude photographs aquired "incidentally" to mass-surveilance and trying to guess what the occasion was.
                    I don't really think I have to explain why you shouldn't be letting these people see everything you have done, are doing or will ever do on the internet.

            </ul>
                <span class="title-main">Measures that RollCall takes</span>
            Although I can't go into too many details without getting very technical, here's an overview:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Messages are encrypted using a hybrid
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_%28cryptosystem%29">RSA</a>/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">AES</a>
                    architecture. A quick overview of how RSA works: Alice wants to send a message to Bob, so she encrypts the messsage with Bob's public key. The only person who can read it,
                    at that point, is Bob; not even Alice can read it after she's encrypted it. Bob then decrypts it with his private key. (If anyone discovered his private key, then they
                    could read the message, too, so it is imperative that the private key is secured). Also, AES is just a symmetric key encryption scheme; you use the same key to encrypt it as
                    decrypt it.<br/>
                    When Charlie sends a message to Denis using RollCall, it contains the AES key, encrypted using RSA with Denis's public key, and the message, encrypted with the AES key
                    (uniquely generated for each message). When Denis goes to decrypt it, he first goes to the AES key, and decrypts it using his RSA private key, and the decrypts the
                    message with the RSA key he just decrypted.<br/>
                    <div style="height: 10px;"></div>
                    Fun fact: RSA stands for Rivest-Shamir-Adleman, the three inventors of the system.
                </li>
                <li>
                    For calls, we rely on the encryption that is required by the WebRTC standard. Recent versions of Firefox are <i>signifigantly</i> than Chromium (Chrome and Opera).<br/>
                    <div style="height: 10px;"></div>
                    Here's the technical description of how Firefox is better: Firefox, starting from Firefox 38, requires the use of Perfect Forward Secrecy, in the form of Diffie-Hellman
                    key exchange or Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman key exchange. This means that the private key is generated uniquely every time, so if it is compromized, it only compromizes
                    one session (as opposed to with RSA, where it compromizes every session).
                </li>
            </ul>
                <span class="title-main">Privacy policy</span>
            Messages and calls are encrypted. For more details, see above; a more in-depth description will be available soon, but for now, just look at the source code.<br/>
            <br/>
            For everything else, anyone can read it. The exposed information includes your e-mail address. I'm trying to come up with ways to make this more secure, but for now,
            you'll just have to live with it.<br/>
